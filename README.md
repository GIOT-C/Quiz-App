# quizApp

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project

This is an intellectual game. The quiz consists of 50 questions. Each question has 4 possible answers. If you answer a question correctly, you will automatically move on to the next question. Each question has a 120 second timer, if you don't answer the question within that time it's game over.

The game also has benefits: 1 right to make a mistake, 1 help and halving 2 possible answers

The project is written in React and TypeScript.

users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Accumulation of bonus benefits
